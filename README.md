# Credit_card_fraud_detection
I built a Credit Card Fraud Detection system to spot fake transactions. Since fraud cases are much rarer than normal ones, I balanced the data to help the model learn better. I tested models like Logistic Regression and found that it could catch most fraud cases while keeping errors low, making the system practical for real-world use.
